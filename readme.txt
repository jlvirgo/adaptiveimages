Free your Joomla website from using desktop-sized images for smartphones and tablets!

The Adaptive Images plugin for Joomla generates images scaled to your device's screen size. This is particularly useful for mobile devices and tablets, where rendering full-sized images is a waste of bandwidth that also delays page load times. To use the plugin, simply install and enable it - that's it! There's a few more optional settings that you may play with, such as image sharpening, image resolutions, image quality, and retina display support.

Adaptive Image Plugin Requirements: 

Apache2 (Sorry IIS users)
PHP 5.x
GD lib 

Additionally, you must have URL Re-writing turned ON in your Joomla's global configuration. 

One method of testing to make sure the plugin is working is to check the newly created "ai-cache" folder in your website's document root. There will be folders named after the pre-determined resolution sizes which will contain the generated images.
